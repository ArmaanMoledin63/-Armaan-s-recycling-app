**Recycling Classification App** 🌱

Overview

Recycling Classification App is an AI-powered mobile application designed to assist users in correctly identifying and disposing of waste items.


**Features**

📸 Real-Time Waste Classification

Users can use their device’s camera to scan waste items.

AI-powered classification provides instant results with high accuracy.

🗑️ Multiple Waste Categories included 

The model can classify waste into the following categories:

Cardboard

Food Waste

Glass

Metal

Paper

Plastic

Other (uncategorized/general waste)

📱 User-Friendly Interface

Intuitive design with simple navigation for ease of use.

Clear instructions for scanning and viewing results.

✅ Detailed Recycling Instructions

Provides users with proper disposal guidelines based on local recycling regulations.

Suggests ways to reduce waste and reuse materials whenever applicable.

🔄 User Feedback System

Users can manually correct classifications to improve model accuracy over time.

Feedback helps refine future predictions and enhance model learning.

**Tech Stack**

🎨 Frontend

React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile development (Android & iOS).

Responsive UI with modern design principles.

🧱 Backend

Flask (Python-based lightweight backend framework) for handling API requests.

RESTful API endpoints for communication between mobile app and server.

🤖 AI & Machine Learning

Deep Learning Model: Xception Model-97% Accuracy (TensorFlow Lite optimized for mobile inference).

Google Cloud Vision API: Enhances recognition for ambiguous items.

☁️ Cloud Services

Firebase (NoSQL database) for storing user preferences, feedback, and recycling information.

Render.com for hosting backend services and managing API endpoints.

🧱 Command Line Interface:

GitBash: To upload code on github and handle conversion of large files 

Render(Cloud) Logs: To monitor predictions server sends to app

**How It Works**

Open the app.

Tap "Scan Now" to start waste classification.

Capture an image of the waste item.

AI processes the image and provides:

Classification result

Recycling instructions

Users can provide feedback if the classification is incorrect.

Proper disposal guidelines are shown 

**Enhancements I am working on:**

🔍 AI Model Improvement: Continuous updates with more training data.

📈 Analytics Dashboard: Track waste disposal habits and impact.

🌟 Gamification: Reward users for sustainable waste disposal.

🌱 Community Challenges: Encourage group efforts in recycling initiatives.

This AI-powered app is a step towards a cleaner and greener planet! 🌍🌱
